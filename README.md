voice_assistant.py: Basic voice-activated assistant

Testing model.py: Starting point for a DeepSeek-R1 integrated assistant

Pre-Final model.py: Basic assistant framework for text-based interactions

FEATURES :


Text-Based Assistant: A starting point for a simple text-based interactive assistant.

Voice Assistant: Basic functionality for a voice-activated assistant using speech recognition and text-to-speech.
